If you're new to prototyping, the number of tools that are now available can be overwhelming. But now you're in luck. 

I wrote [a post for MoneySummit](http://www.moneysummit.com/the-summit/2014/12/10/9-mobile-prototyping-tools-every-designer-should-consider) comparing the prototyping tools I've used. I break down what each tool is best suited for and the upsides and downsides of each of them. Merry Christmas!
