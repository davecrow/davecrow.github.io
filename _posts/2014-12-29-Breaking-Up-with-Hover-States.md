I [published a satirical piece on Medium](https://medium.com/@davidlcrow/dear-hover-state-its-time-to-break-up-122f8d8ca09) today about my breakup with hover states.

Just to be clear - I'm not saying that hover states should never be used. They're fine to accent interactions for non-touch users (button color change, menu item highlights, etc). But when a hover state is relied on for users to know something is clickable or for a major piece of functionality to work - it becomes problematic. As we move into an era where touchscreen devices are the primary way people access information, I don't think it's acceptable to have a broken experience because the designer didn't take the time to come up with a non-hover interaction. There are always other options. We just have to re-train ourselves to not rely on hover states like we used to. It's part of being in a mobile-first world.

On an unrelated note - this was my first time posting on Medium and I have to say it's really nice. The authoring experience is really clean. And I was impressed with how it cleaned up my hyphens.
