Today my company, MoneyDesktop, made some big announcements. The first of which is that we're changing our name from MoneyDesktop to [MX](http://mxenabled.com). Our product line has outgrown being tied to the desktop, so MX makes a lot more sense moving forward. And it's the closest I'll ever get to being in MxPx (rimshot please!).

We also announced a new product we've been working on since the beginning of the year, called [Helios](http://www.mxenabled.com/products/helios/). It's a banking app that brings mobile banking (money transfers, billpay, check deposit, etc) and personal financial management (account aggregation, budgets, categorization, etc) together for the first time. That alone is great, but it's also built on a cross-platform framework that allows us to manage one code base but run native apps on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Amazon FireTV, Mac OS X and more. 

Designing an app that is platform agnostic has brought up some unique challenges. [I wrote an article about the process for Money Summit](http://www.moneysummit.com/the-summit/2014/9/23/behind-the-scenes-designing-a-banking-app-for-any-device) if you want a behind-the-scenes look.
