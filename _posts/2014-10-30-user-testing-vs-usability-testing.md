User testing. Focus group. Usability testing.

I often see the [terms get used interchangeably](https://twitter.com/DavidLCrow/status/528008693132980225), but there’s an important difference.

I’m a big proponent of usability testing. Watching people use your product is the best way to improve. But it’s important to understand that the point is to make sure a user can accomplish a task.

I heard an analogy  that usability testing is like watching people walk through a doorway to make sure they don’t trip. It’s not asking people if they like the doorway.

User testing and focus groups turn a project into design by committee. Putting the product in front of people to  see what they like or don’t like is a [futile exercise](https://medium.com/@mulegirl/focus-groups-are-worthless-7d30891e58f1). People are bad at self-reporting if they would use or like a product. 

So if you want to improve your product skip the user test and run a usability test instead.
