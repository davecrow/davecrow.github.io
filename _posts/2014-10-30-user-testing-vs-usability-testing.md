User test. Focus group. Usability test.

I often see the [terms get used interchangeably](https://twitter.com/DavidLCrow/status/528008693132980225), but there’s an important difference.

I’m a big proponent of usability testing. Watching people use your product is the best way to improve. But it’s important to understand that the point is to make sure a user can accomplish a task, not to find out if they like the product. I've heard it said that usability testing is like watching people walk through a doorway to make sure they don’t trip. It’s not asking people if they like the doorway. (I wish I could remember the source of that analogy.)

People who aren't tech-savvy often blame themselves when they can't figure out how to do something. So, when running a usability test, I always tell people, "We're not testing you. We're testing the app." (A line I learned from [Steve Krug's work.](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)) This removes the fear of doing something wrong. 

User testing and focus groups, on the other hand, turn a project into design by committee. Putting the product in front of people to  see what they like or don’t like is a [futile exercise](https://medium.com/@mulegirl/focus-groups-are-worthless-7d30891e58f1). People are bad at self-reporting if they would use or like a product. 

So if you want to improve your product skip the user test and run a usability test instead.
