I am in a constant effort to get my coworkers to stop emailing me. I hate email as the default form of workplace communication . And not because I get mounds of it. Most days I get a very manageable about of email.

But I have all notifications turned off. I don’t want to be interrupted by email. When sitting next to someone I watch their email notifications going off with subject lines and preview and I wonder how the hell they get any work done.

And I’ve learned that I’m unable to resist the little red badge notification. So it’s best if I set aside time to process email.

Another thing that has helped a lot is creating an “unread” smart filter in Apple Mail. It’s kind of a cheater’s way of attaining inbox zero. But I hate looking at a full inbox all the time and deleting every email causes me a certain amount of anxiety. This system simply moves messages out of view as their read, and the default inbox becomes something like a Gmail archive.

Just to send a two sentence email, I have to go through the pain of creating a subject line. There’s a ton of cognitive overhead that goes into this. Just to send an email that says “hey, can we meet soon?” I have to think about a subject that doesn’t imply there’s something seriously wrong. A lot can be read into a subject line. I’d much rather send that message via chat and avoid that stress.
