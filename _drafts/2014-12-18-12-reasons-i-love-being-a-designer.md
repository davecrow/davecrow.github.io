I recently presented at DRAFT - the designer [Meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/DRAFT-design/) I help organize. Since it's the holiday season, I decided to do a kind of reflective talk on 12 reasons I love being a designer.

## #12 - It’s like being an artist, but you actually make money.
I used to have this artistic, “punk rock” ethos that said making money didn’t matter. But now I’m 32 and a dad, and making money doesn’t seem like such a bad idea. I have friends who are incredibly talented artists or musicians, but none of them are really making a living at it. Even the ones who have managed to be able to do it full time are scraping by. Design lets me have a creative job without having to be a starving artist.

## #11 - Designers are interesting people.
Generally I find that people in the design community are very interesting. You have a mix of musicians, artists, photographers and more that found their way into design. You meet people who have worked on really fascinating stuff. 

## #10 - Design has made me more successful at every job I’ve ever had.
I’ve worked design into almost every job I’ve ever had. In college I worked at The UPS Store (called Mailboxes, Etc back then) and the owner asked me to make some signs. All I had was a PC with MS Publisher on it, but the designer in me couldn’t just throw words on a page in Times New Roman and call it a day. It was fun for me to try and match corporate branding so you couldn’t tell my signs from the corporate ones. And my boss took notice. Pretty soon I was the only employee asked to make signs. Even after I left that job he called me up a few times to design things. It was my first experience in freelance work.

## #9 - The combination of art + technology.
In high school I knew I wanted to do something on computers, but I didn’t even really know that the design field even existed. So I took a CISCO computer networking class…and kind of hated it. Then, just to fill in an hour my senior year, I took a graphic design class and fell in love. I was never a great art student, but Photoshop allowed me to create things that looked good. Obviously it takes a blend of art and technology to make websites and software, but that blend exists in print design as well. There’s a lot of tech in the printing process, and you can create some amazing stuff if you understand how to take advantage of it.

## #8 - Weekends & holidays with my family
My dad manages a grocery store and my mom is a nurse. So growing up our family life always revolved around my parents work schedule. It was rare to get a weekend where both parents were home. Dad often had to work holidays, so we’d have to squeeze in celebrations on different days. It felt like everyone else got the occasional 3 day weekend, but my parents still had to work. So I’m really grateful to have a job where I can spend weekends with my kids and I don’t feel like I’m a slave to my work schedule. It’s great to be able to make plans without having to check my work schedule first.

## #7 - There are more tools, and better tools, than ever before
Last time I talked about prototyping with Pixate, and I posted on our blog about a bunch of other prototyping tools. New software like Sketch, Affinity, and Pixelmatr is coming out. And the classic Adobe tools are still getting better and better. It’s easy to take these things for granted, but here’s a clip of a Photoshop 1.0 tutorial. It should show you how far our tools have come.

## #6 -  There’s more opportunity than ever
There is more design work available than ever before. Marc Andreessen is known for saying “software is eating the world.” And all that software needs designed. I recently saw some stats saying that 4 billion people in the world are now online. All those websites and apps need designed. And even print design is getting cheaper and faster. Hell, you can even design your own line of greeting cards and sell them on Etsy. There’s more work available, and more ways to become a designer than ever.

## #5 - There’s always more to learn
Design is changing at the speed of tech. So there’s always more to learn. Some people bemoan this fact, and it can feel overwhelming. But I find it exciting. There’s always a new skill to tinker with, or new tool to try out. There’s no reason to get bored as a designer.

## #4 - I get to sit at a computer and make stuff all day
Going back to my parents - they both have jobs that require them to be on their feet all day. And most of the people in my hometown work in some kind of manual labor. Me? I get pissed when I have to put Ikea furniture together. So I’m grateful to not have a back-breaking job.

## #3 - I get to make stuff people use and add value to their lives
Product design is great because you’re designing this thing that people will interact with. And when done well, these tools can add a lot of value to people’s lives. That’s one thing that makes the work at MX so exciting - there’s hardly anything more critical to people than their finances. So building tools that people rely on manager their money is something worth getting up for.

## #2 - Design adds beauty to the world
I’m a big believer that we should all strive to leave the world a little better than we found it. And adding beauty is a great way to do that. As much as I find it annoying when my job is described as “making things pretty,” there is some truth there. Making things look good isn’t a superficial task. It makes things easier to use and it communicates messages more clearly. And that’s a great way to make the world a little better.

## #1 - I do what I love
It’s a little cliché, but when I step back for a minute I have to be grateful that I get to do something I enjoy for a living. I do get annoyed with phrases like this because sometimes it’s said with this tone of “if you don’t like your job, it’s your fault.” But not everyone has the luxury of quitting their job to “do what they love” all day. It’s an incredible privilege to be in this position. Design isn’t usually a job that people get into because it was the only thing available and they had to pay the bills. People usually become designers because they liked the work at some point. It’s easy to get cynical and jaded when doing the work day in and day out. It can be a grind. So this is just a reminder to take a moment and remind yourself why you got into this business. Remind yourself why you loved the work. And if you don’t love your day job, find a side project. But being a designer opens up opportunities that most people in the world are envious of. It’s important to keep that in mind on the bad days.

## Conclusion
So those are my 12 reasons I love being a designer. Hopefully some of them resonated with you. I’ll close by suggesting that you take a few minutes during the holiday season to make your own list. It never hurts to count your blessings.
